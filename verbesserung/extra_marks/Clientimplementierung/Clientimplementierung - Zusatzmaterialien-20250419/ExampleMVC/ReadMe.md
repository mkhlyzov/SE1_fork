# Description

This example project covers two ways to implement the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. If you would like to get a detailed discussion of the functionality shown here and tips on how to implement it in your own project, we recommend that you attend the related tutorial.

You can find the Observer pattern based on the observer packages (outdated, not recommended) and the Property Changed pattern-based ones in the propchange packages. Both provide very similar functionality. Note, we recommend utilizing the Property Changes based solution as it can become more flexible and refined in the long run.
