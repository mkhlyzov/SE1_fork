	 * Below, you can find an example of how to use both required HTTP operations,
	 * i.e., POST and GET to communicate with the server.
	 * 
	 * Note, this is only an example. Hence, your own implementation should NOT
	 * place all the logic in a single main method!
	 * 
	 * Further, I would recommend that you check out: a) The JavaDoc of the network
	 * message library, which describes all messages, and their CTORs/methods. You
	 * can find it here http://swe1.wst.univie.ac.at/ b) The informal network
	 * documentation is given in Moodle, which describes which messages must be used
	 * when and how.
